  abstract = {The TrackDLO algorithm estimates the shape of a Deformable Linear Object (DLO) under occlusion from a sequence of RGB-D images. TrackDLO is vision-only and runs in real-time. It requires no external state information from physics modeling, simulation, visual markers, or contact as input. The algorithm improves on previous approaches by addressing three common scenarios which cause tracking failure: tip occlusion, mid-section occlusion, and self-occlusion. This is achieved through the application of Motion Coherence Theory to impute the spatial velocity of occluded nodes, the use of the topological geodesic distance to track self-occluding DLOs, and the introduction of a non-Gaussian kernel that only penalizes lower-order spatial displacement derivatives to reflect DLO physics. Improved real-time DLO tracking under mid-section occlusion, tip occlusion, and self-occlusion is demonstrated experimentally. The source code and demonstration data are publicly released.},

    abstract = {Perception of the shapes of deforming objects like wires enables their monitoring and manipulation by autonomous robots. This paper presents detection, classification, and instance segmentation of deformable wires from a cluttered scene in RGBD imagery. This work uses the Detectron2 implementation of Mask R-CNN trained with the PointRend mask head on the UIUCWires dataset as the framework for wire instance segmentation on RGB imagery, a method demonstrated to perform well for the instance segmentation task in previous work. In this work, the instance bitmask is directly used to segment individual object point clouds, an important step toward wire shape representation for manipulation tasks.},

    month = {May},
    abstract = {This work presents an algorithm for tracking the shape of multiple entangling Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) from a sequence of RGB-D images. This algorithm runs in real-time and improves on previous single-DLO tracking approaches by enabling tracking of multiple objects. This is achieved using Global-Local Topology Preservation (GLTP). This work uses the geodesic distance in GLTP to define the distance between separate objects and the distance between different parts of the same object. Tracking multiple entangling DLOs is demonstrated experimentally. The source code is publicly released. },
