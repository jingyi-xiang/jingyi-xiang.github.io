I am an undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at the University of at Illinois Urbana-Champaign (expected to graduate in May 2024). For a third of my life I studied music and arts; for another third of my life I dreamed of becoming a theoretical physicist. Now I am mainly interested in robotics, computer vision, and robotic manipulation.
