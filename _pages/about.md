I am an undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign with research interests in perception, tactile sensing, and robotic manipulation. 

I will be joining the [RoboTouch Lab](http://robotouchlab.web.illinois.edu/) at UIUC as a Computer Science Ph.D. student starting Fall 2024, advised by [Prof. Wenzhen Yuan](http://robotouch.ri.cmu.edu/yuanwz/). Previously, I worked with the [Bretl Research Group](http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/) under the mentorship of Ph.D. candidate [Holly Dinkel](https://hollydinkel.github.io/) as an undergraduate researcher, where I led the development of tracking algorithms for deformable linear objects.
