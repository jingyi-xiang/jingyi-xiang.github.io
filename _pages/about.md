I am an undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at the University of at Illinois Urbana-Champaign (expected to graduate in May 2024). For a third of my life I studied music and arts; for another third of my life I dreamed of becoming a theoretical physicist. Now I am mainly interested in robotics, computer vision, and robotic manipulation.

Since January 2022, I have been assisting a robotic caretaking project lead by Ph.D. candidate Holly Dinkel from the UIUC Bretl Research Group. My current research focuses on perception and tracking of deformable linear objects (e.g. ropes and cables).

I competed in the VEX Robotics Competition from 2018 - 2021, an extracurricular activity that eventually provoked my interest in robotics.
