I am a first-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Wenzhen Yuan](http://robotouch.ri.cmu.edu/yuanwz/). My research interests include **tactile sensing** and **robotic manipulation**. 

I obtained my B.S. in electrical engineering at UIUC with Highest Honor, during which I led the development of deformable linear object tracking algorithms while working with [Prof. Timothy Bretl](http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/).

Outside of research, I enjoy taking photos and drawing.
