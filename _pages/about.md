I am a first-year computer science Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Wenzhen Yuan](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/yuanwz). My research interests include **tactile sensing** and **robotic manipulation**. 

I obtained my B.S. in electrical engineering at UIUC with Highest Honor, during which I led the development of deformable linear object tracking algorithms while working with [Prof. Timothy Bretl](http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/).

I do a bunch of random things outside of research. I studied voice for almost 10 years when I was a teenager. I also draw and take photos.
