I am an undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at the University of at Illinois Urbana-Champaign (graduating in May 2024). For a third of my life I studied music and arts; for another third of my life I dreamed of becoming a theoretical physicist. Now I am mainly interested in robotics, computer vision, and robotic manipulation.

Since January 2022, I have been assisting a robotic caretaking project led by Ph.D. candidate [Holly Dinkel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hollymdinkel/) from the [Bretl Research Group](http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/). My current research focuses on perception and tracking of deformable linear objects (e.g. ropes and cables). See below for my [publications](https://jingyi-xiang.github.io/publications/) and [Research](https://jingyi-xiang.github.io/research/) for my research experiences.

I competed in the VEX Robotics Competition from 2018 - 2021, an extracurricular activity that eventually sparked my interest in robotics. See [Miscellaneous](https://jingyi-xiang.github.io/miscellaneous/) for some of my robots.
