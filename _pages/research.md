This page lists my research experiences.

##### **Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program (Spring 2022)**
---
* Selected as one of the 60 participants from a pool of more than 500 applicants to work with a graduate student mentor on research projects.
* Implemented the Copy-Paste Augmentation method in an automated dataset generation process to scale the amount of available training data and to eliminate the time-consuming process of manual image annotation.
* Identified, implemented, and evaluated two state-of-the-art deformable linear object instance segmentation algorithms.
* Used the instance segmentation masks output from Mask R-CNN to segment featureless point clouds in stereo depth imagery.
* Presented the below [poster](https://jingyi-xiang.github.io/assets/pdf/poster_urs22.pdf) at the 2022 UIUC Undergraduate Research Symposium.

##### **Illinois Space Grant Consortium's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (Summer 2022)**
---
* Selected to participate in a paid 10-week summer research program.
* Designed and 3D printed custom camera mounts for linking the camera and the robot end-effector.
* Calibrated our hardware system with fiducial markers and two eye-in-hand camera calibration algorithms: the Tsai-Lenz algorithm and a recently published method based on pose graph optimization.
* Basing off of point set registration algorithm [Global-Local Toplogy Preservation](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_workshops_2014/W04/papers/Ge_Non-rigid_Point_Set_2014_CVPR_paper.pdf), developed a new method for tracking multiple deformable linear objects simultaneously without contiuous instance segmentation.
* Delivered a 15-minute presentation at the program symposium.

##### **ECE Independent Study with the Bretl Research Group (Fall 2022 - Spring 2023)**
---
* Collaborated with other researchers in the group to create [COCOpen](https://rmdlo.github.io/COCOpen-OpenCV/), an open-source library that automatically generates datasets of color images with objects of interest, labeled with object instance segmentation masks, bounding boxes, and category identification.
* Developed a new deformable linear object tracking algorithm, TrackDLO, for robust deformable linear object tracking under occlusion and incomplete data input.
* Developed the open-source [TrackDLO ROS (Robot Operating System) package](https://github.com/RMDLO/trackdlo) with the TrackDLO algorithm implemented in both C++.
* Delivered two hour-long research presentations to the Bretl Research Group on the topic of deformable object perception and tracking (Presentation slides: [Fall 2022](https://jingyi-xiang.github.io/assets/pdf/BRG_Fall_2022.pdf), [Spring 2023](https://jingyi-xiang.github.io/assets/pdf/BRG_Spring_2023.pdf)).
* Completed a paper on the TrackDLO algorithm which was accepted into the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L).
* Completed an extended abstract on simultaneous multi-DLO tracking and presented the below poster at IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) Workshop on Representing and Manipulating Deformable Objects.
