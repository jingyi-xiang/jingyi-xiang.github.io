<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am an undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (graduating in May 2024). For a third of my life I studied music and arts; for another third of my life I dreamed of becoming a theoretical physicist. My current research interests lie in the fields of computer vision and robotic manipulation.</p> <p>Since January 2022, I have been assisting a robotic caretaking project led by Ph.D. candidate <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hollymdinkel/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Holly Dinkel</a> from the <a href="http://bretl.csl.illinois.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bretl Research Group</a>. My current research focuses on the perception and tracking of deformable linear objects (e.g. ropes and cables). See below for my <a href="https://jingyi-xiang.github.io/publications/">publications</a> and <a href="https://jingyi-xiang.github.io/research/">Research</a> for my research experiences.</p> <p>I competed in the <a href="https://www.vexrobotics.com/competition" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">VEX Robotics Competition</a> from 2018 - 2021, an extracurricular activity that eventually sparked my interest in robotics (my team’s stats can be found <a href="https://vexdb.io/teams/view/97963A?t=skills" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>).
